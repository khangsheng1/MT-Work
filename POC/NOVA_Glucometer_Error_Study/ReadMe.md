# Nova Glucometer Error Monitoring Dashboard

This repository contains a Power BI dashboard that tracks Nova glucometer error events and monthly testing volumes. The goal is to surface error trends, highlight locations and operators with higher error counts, and place those counts in context with total tests by month.

## Overview

The dashboard uses an event table for flagged tests and a small reference table for monthly test counts. This lets you compute both absolute counts and error rates per month, location, device, and operator.

---

## Data model

**Tables in use**

### Table1 â€” Flagged events from Nova export
Event level rows with one record per flagged test.

Key columns  
- `Date/Time`  
- `Flow Error` (error code or text)  
- `Device`  
- `Location`  
- `Operator Full Name` (redacted in this repository)  
- Helper date fields used for grouping and filtering: `Date`, `Year`, `Month #`, `MonthName`

### Table2 â€” Monthly total test counts
A static reference table with the total number of tests performed each month. This acts as the denominator for error rate.

Columns  
- `Year`  
- `Month #`  
- `Month`  
- `# of Test Per Month`  
- `Total Tests` (optional, can mirror # of Test Per Month)

**Relationships**

| From table | Column   | â†’ | To table | Column   | Cardinality | Direction |
|------------|----------|---|----------|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Table1     | Month #  | â†’ | Table2   | Month #  | Many to one | Single    |

## Measures

### Static date anchors
Displayed as cards that do not respond to slicers. Useful for showing the overall dataset range.

```DAX
Earliest Date (Static) =
CALCULATE(
    MIN('Table1'[Date/Time]),
    ALL('Table1')
)

Latest Date (Static) =
CALCULATE(
    MAX('Table1'[Date/Time]),
    ALL('Table1')
)
```

### Total tests that respect the date slicer

Maps visible months in the current filter context to the monthly totals in Table2. Works even if the slicer is on DateTable.

```
Total Tests =
VAR MonthsVisible =
    SUMMARIZE(
        'Table1',
        'Table1'[Year],
        'Table1'[Month #]
    )
RETURN
CALCULATE(
    SUM('Table2'[# of Test Per Month]),
    TREATAS(
        MonthsVisible,
        'Table2'[Year],
        'Table2'[Month #]
    )
)
```
### Error count

```
Error Rate % = DIVIDE([Count of Flow Error1],[Total Tests])
```

## Core visuals

1. KPI cards for:
     - Total Number of Tests  
     - Total Errors  
     - Error Rate %  
     - Estimated spend on errors (optional, based on a per-event cost you define)  
2. Bar chart of **Flow Error** by count  
3. Bar chart of **Location** by count  
4. Table of **Operator Full Name** with counts (names redacted here)  
5. Column chart of **Error Count by Month** using Month from the date dimension  
6. Date range slicer bound to the calendar

## Notes and tips
- The monthly totals in Table2 are static and must be updated when a new month completes.
- Keep filter direction single from Table2 to Table1 when relating on `Month #`. For multi-year reports, include `Year` in the relationship key or rely on the TREATAS pattern above

## Limitations
- Patient level data is not included here and is redacted in production workbooks
- Manual refresh of Table2 is required unless you automate extraction
- Operator names are removed in shared screenshots for privacy

## Future improvements
- Automate population of Table2 from LIS or instrument logs
- Add thresholds and conditional formatting for high error months
- Drill-through pages for device and operator performance
- Dataflow or pipeline for scheduled refresh in the service

## Tools Used
- Power BI Service
- DAX
- Excel for pre-processing Nova exports

## Disclaimer
This dashboard uses de-identified, internal quality improvement data. All operator names are redacted. No patient identifiable information is stored in this repository. The visualizations are for process monitoring and do not represent clinical performance or outcomes.
